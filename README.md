## Description
Why buy an apple watch when you can spend your weekends building a microcontroller based "smart" watch instead? the TG-Watch is an open source, not-dumb watch meant for makers who want to hack on their watch or as great starting point to learn about programming.

Some of its features include:
- a 240x240, 1.54" lcd
- capacitive touchscreen
- USB Type-C port (2.0)
- Step counter and pedometer
- vibration motor and haptic motor driver
- Bluetooth 5, Bluetooth mesh, Thread, ZigBee

## Software
The TG-Watch was designed to run circuitpython, this gives anyone the flexibility to run what they can write. Additionally, there is on-going development for a python GUI framework (TG-Gui-4 and TG-Gui 5) that runs on the watch. This framework is intended to make writing UI programs to run on the fun and approachable. (Currently under going a re-write)
